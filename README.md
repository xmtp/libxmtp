# LibXMTP

![https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg) ![https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_status-Alpha-orange)

LibXMTP is a shared library encapsulating the core functionality of the XMTP messaging protocol, such as cryptography, networking, and language bindings.

> **Important**
> This software is in **alpha** status and ready for you to start experimenting with. However, we do not recommend using alpha software in production apps. Expect frequent changes as we add features and iterate based on feedback.

## Requirements

- Install [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#using-foundryup)

## Development

Start Docker Desktop.

- To install other dependencies and start background services:

  ```
  dev/up
  ```

  Specifically, this command creates and runs an XMTP node in Docker Desktop.

- To run tests:

  ```
  dev/test
  ```

## Quick Start (Dev Containers)

This project supports containerized development. From Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension specify the Dockerfile as the target:

`Reopen in Container`

or

Command line build using docker

```bash
docker build . -t libxmtp:1
```

## Structure

libxmtp/

├ [`bindings_ffi`](./bindings_ffi): FFI bindings for Android and iOS (in progress)

├ [`bindings_wasm`](./bindings_wasm): Wasm bindings (in progress)

├ examples/

   ├ [`android/xmtpv3_example`](./examples/android/xmtpv3_example): Example Android app (in progress)

   └ [`cli`](./examples/cli): Example XMTP console client. Use the CLI to try out sending double ratchet messages on the XMTP `dev` network.

├ [`xmtp_api_grpc`](./xmtp_api_grpc): API client for XMTP's gRPC API, using code from `xmtp_proto`

├ [`xmtp_api_grpc_gateway`](./xmtp_api_grpc_gateway): API client for XMTP's gRPC Gateway API, using code from `xmtp_proto` (in progress)

├ [`xmtp_cryptography`](./xmtp_cryptography): Cryptographic operations

├ [`xmtp_mls`](./xmtp_mls): Version 3 of XMTP which implements [Messaging Layer Security](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/).

├ [`xmtp_proto`](./xmtp_proto): Generated code for handling XMTP protocol buffers

└ [`xmtp_v2`](./xmtp_v2): Version 2 of XMTP which uses a [user key bundle](https://xmtp.org/docs/concepts/key-generation-and-usage) to encrypt and exchange messages.


### Run the benchmarks

**possible benchmarks include:**

- `group_limit`: benchmarks surrounding maximum members adding/removed from
  group
- `crypto`: benchmarks surrounding cryptographic functions

**Example Commands**

- **Run a specific category of benchmark**
  `cargo bench --features bench -p xmtp_mls --bench group_limit`
- **Run against dev grpc** DEV_GRPC=1 cargo bench --features bench -p xmtp_mls
  --bench group_limit
- **Just run all benchmarks** ./dev/bench
- **Run one specific benchmark** ./dev/bench add_1_member_to_group
- **Generate flamegraph from one benchmark** ./dev/flamegraph
  add_1_member_to_group
