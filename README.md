# Libxmtp

Libxmtp is a monorepo with multiple crates that encapsulate parts of XMTP messaging functionality, cryptography or bindings to other languages.

## Requirements

- To build `xmtp_proto` Buf must be installed on your machine. Visit the [Buf documentation](https://buf.build/docs/installation) for more info

## Structure

Top-level

- xmtp/ - the pure Rust implementation of XMTP APIs, agnostic to any per-language or per-platform binding
- xmtp_keystore - first crate, implements the Keystore API in Rust
- xmtp_proto - Generated code for handling XMTP protocol buffers
- xmtp_networking - API client for XMTP's GRPC API, using code from `xmtp_proto`
- bindings_swift - Swift bindings

## Rust Keystore QuickStart

- cd `xmtp_keystore`
- `cargo test`

## XMTP v3

This repo also contains development on the next version of the XMTP protocol, XMTP v3, featuring double-ratchet encryption built on the vodozemac library. For more information see the [README](xmtpv3/README.md) in the xmtpv3 directory.
