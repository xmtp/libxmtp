# HACK HACK HACK
# Here's the ultra-hack, we need to inject "import XMTPRustSwift" into the top of the Swift files
# before copying them over so they'll get the headers we moved to "include/Generated".
#
# Moreover, we inject the following lines to allow RustStrings to be interpreted as NSErrors and automatically
# displayed in the debugger:
# https://github.com/chinedufn/swift-bridge/issues/150

# extension RustString: @unchecked Sendable {}
#
# extension RustString: LocalizedError {
#     public var errorDescription: String? {
#         return NSLocalizedString("XMTP Rust Error: \(self.as_str().toString())", comment: self.as_str().toString())
#     }
