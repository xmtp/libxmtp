# XMTP Rust Swift

This repo builds a crate for iOS targets and packages it in an XMTPRustSwift.xcframework file.

It pairs with [xmtp-rust-swift](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-rust-swift) which is a tiny public repo hosting a Swift Package/Cocoapod that wraps the XMTPRustSwift.xcframework produced here.

## Structure

- `Cargo.toml` here can reference any local crate in `libxmtp`, such as `xmtp_crypto` or `xmtp_networking`
- `include/module.modulemap` - can remain untouched as it just imports the `xmtp_rust_swift.h` header

## Prerequisites

- Rust
- Run `make download-toolchains` to get all the iOS and MacOS toolchains

## Workflow

- Write code in `./src` to expose functionality to Swift
- Run `cargo test` to make sure your code works

### Building xcframework

- Run `make framework`

### Building the binaries and bindings

The Build Action rebuilds all binaries and bindings on every commit to this branch. It also packages everything into an artifact `xmtp-rust-swift.zip` that can be unzipped over the target repo (`xmtp/xmtp-rust-swift`).

### Releasing new version

Tag the commit you want to release with the appropriate version (e.g. 0.3.0-beta0).
The Release github workflow will do the following:

- check out `xmtp-rust-repo` and update it with the contents of the `xmtp-rust-swift.zip` file that was generated by the Build action.
- push new commit to the `xmtp-rust-swift` repo and tag it with the same tag

NOTES: To allow the workflow to push to another repo the setup follows [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/making-authenticated-api-requests-with-a-github-app-in-a-github-actions-workflow#authenticating-with-a-github-app). It uses [this app installed on the org](https://github.com/organizations/xmtp/settings/apps/libxmtp-release). The relevant secrets are stored only [in this repo](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp/settings/secrets/actions). If additional repos are added to this workflow they MUST be added to [this installation](https://github.com/organizations/xmtp/settings/installations/39118494) of the app.

### Steps for xmtp-ios SDK integration

- Get set up with Xcode
- Clone [xmtp-ios](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-ios)
- Open Xcode, then open the `xmtp-ios` folder at the top-level in Xcode
- Follow README.md there to get Xcode roughly set up
- Go to `Package.swift` and find the dependencies section. Add:

```swift
        .package(url: "../xmtp-rust-swift/", branch: "your-local-branch")
```

- Make a local commit in xmtp-rust-swift (must be a commit to get picked up by Swift Package) and reference it in Xcode
- Note: commits to the same branch will not be picked up by Xcode, you must right-click the Swift package and do "Update Package"

## End-to-end React Native Walkthrough

Repositories you'll need:
- https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-react-native
- https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-ios
- https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-rust-swift
- Our current repo: https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp

Goal: add a "hello from Rust" function that a React Native app can call in JS (xmtp-react-native), that invokes Swift code (xmtp-ios), that calls into Rust code (xmtp-rust-swift + libxmtp/bindings_swift)

1. **Add the "hello from Rust" function to `libxmtp/bindings_swift/lib.rs`**

Since we're exposing a stateless and static function, we can use `sha256` and `keccak256` as examples. Notice in `lib.rs` the ffi module declarations for these functions
```
    extern "Rust" {
        fn sha256(data: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8>;
        fn keccak256(data: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8>;
+       fn hello_from_rust(name: String) -> String;
        ...
    }
```

And the implementations below
```
fn sha256(data: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    let result = hashes::sha256(data.as_slice());
    result.to_vec()
}

fn keccak256(data: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    let result = hashes::keccak256(data.as_slice());
    result.to_vec()
}

+ fn hello_from_rust(name: String) -> String {
+     format!("Hello, {} from Rust!", name)
+ }
```

2. **Build a new XMTPRustSwift.xcframework and push it to the `xmtp-rust-swift` repo**
- Make sure you're in `bindings_swift` crate
- After you make your code changes (and maybe even add a unit test) then utter: `make swift` to build and push the XMTPRustSwift.xcframework file to xmtp-rust-swift

Possible issues: You need toolchains (run `make download-toolchains` from above)

3. **Go into `xmtp-rust-swift` and check that there are diffs `git diff`**
- You should see a changeset similar but not identical to:
  ```
    modified:   Sources/XMTPRust/xmtp_rust_swift.swift
    modified:   XMTPRustSwift.xcframework/Info.plist
    modified:   XMTPRustSwift.xcframework/ios-arm64/Headers/Generated/xmtp_rust_swift/xmtp_rust_swift.h
    modified:   XMTPRustSwift.xcframework/ios-arm64/libxmtp_rust_swift.a
    modified:   XMTPRustSwift.xcframework/ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/Headers/Generated/xmtp_rust_swift/xmtp_rust_swift.h
    modified:   XMTPRustSwift.xcframework/ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/libxmtp_rust_swift.a
    modified:   XMTPRustSwift.xcframework/macos-arm64_x86_64/Headers/Generated/xmtp_rust_swift/xmtp_rust_swift.h
    modified:   XMTPRustSwift.xcframework/macos-arm64_x86_64/libxmtp_rust_swift.a
    modified:   Sources/XMTPRust/xmtp_rust_swift.swift
  ```
- Check that XMTPRustSwift.xcframework is roughly ~50-60MB, if not then the `bindings_swift` build profile is messed up and not optimizing built binary size correctly. Check the Cargo.toml and check the top-level Cargo.toml workspace for libxmtp.
```
$ du -hs XMTPRustSwift.xcframework
55M    XMTPRustSwift.xcframework
```
- Create a new local branch like `git checkout -b my_local_hello_from_rust`

4. **Now switch repos again to `xmtp-ios`**
- Follow README steps in xmtp-ios to get set up
- Open xmtp-ios in Xcode as a directory. Do not open the `example/*.xcodeproject` file as the entrypoint
- You should see Swift packages syncing on the left side
- Open up `Package.swift` and replace the xmtp-rust-swift branch (see a few sections above for xmtp-ios integration)
- Run the unit tests in Xcode, at this point the steps are standard to xmtp-ios (not Rust-integration specific) and documented in the xmtp-ios README.md
- Find a location in the code that uses `XMTPRust`'s sha256 or keccak256 functions. Add an additional call to `hello_from_rust`.
- Test that the call compiles correctly and emits the correct string

5. **OPTIONAL: You want to push a Cocoapod**
- There are two cocoapods in play. Cocoapod `XMTPRust` comes from the `xmtp-rust-swift` repo and `XMTP` comes from `xmtp-ios` and depends on `XMTPRust`
- Make sure your local branch of xmtp-rust-swift passes `pod lib lint XMTPRust.podspec --allow-warnings`
- To push the `XMTPRust` cocoapod, go to `xmtp-rust-swift` and bump the version in the `XMTPRust.podspec` file to your intended one
- Open a PR, get it merged (push branches remotely with care, as the framework files form a 40MB diff, I only do it when I'm very confident in local changes)
- Then tag your commit on main `git checkout main && git pull && git tag X.X.X-yyyyyy`, which should match the version in the podspec
- Then push the tag up `git push origin --tags`
- Then release the cocoapod: `pod trunk push XMTPRust.podspec --allow-warnings`
- You should get an email when the release is successful
- If you don't have permission, register your email with Cocoapods and then have someone with permission add you.
- It may take up to hours after the release for your new version to be ready

[Search Query for XMTP Pod Versions](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ACocoaPods%2FSpecs+XMTP&type=commits)

NOTE: The XMTP cocoapod is pushed from xmtp-ios and requires documentation in that repository. Make sure to update the podspec dependency in `XMTP.podspec` that references `XMTPRust`.

6. **Extra Credit: Create a helloFromRust function in @xmtp/react-native-sdk**
- Write code that surfaces the `hello_from_rust` XMTPRust function as part of the `xmtp-ios` SDK i.e. Write a Swift function that wraps it, add it to Client or make it static etc
- Publish the XMTP cocoapod (touched on but not fully covered above)
- Clone and cd into `xmtp-react-native`
- Update `ios/XMTPReactNative.podspec` to use your newly publishec version of the `XMTP` Cocoapod
- Follow development instructions within xmtp-react-native to create a new function for the `XMTPModule` Typescript interface
- Write code in `XMTPModule.swift` that calls into `XMTP` to invoke your Swift wrapper for `hello_from_rust`. You might need to make an Android shim or throw a not-implemented error of sorts for Android
- Follow the xmtp-react-native instructions to run the iOS RN example app
