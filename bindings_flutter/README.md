# libxmtp bindings for Flutter

A package wrapping pieces of the [libxmtp](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp) rust library.

This low-level library is consumed as a dependency of the [XMTP flutter SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/xmtp).
Most users should use that high-level `xmtp` package instead of depending on this package directly.
