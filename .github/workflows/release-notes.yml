            You are drafting release notes for a software SDK. The audience is end users
            of this SDK, not contributors to this repo.

            Include changes to:
            - Shared Rust crates (xmtp_mls, xmtp_db, xmtp_id, xmtp_cryptography,
              xmtp_proto, xmtp_api, xmtp_api_d14n) that affect SDK behavior
            - The SDK's own bindings directory (e.g., bindings/mobile and sdks/ios for iOS)

            Exclude changes to:
            - Other SDK bindings (e.g., bindings/wasm, bindings/node for an iOS release)
            - CI/CD workflows, dev tooling, documentation, and repo infrastructure
            - Test-only changes with no user-facing impact

            The following release note files are empty scaffolds that need a complete first draft.
            For each file listed below:

            1. Run `git diff <previous_tag>..HEAD -- . ':!docs/release-notes'` to see code changes.
            2. Run `git log --oneline <previous_tag>..HEAD` for commit history.
            3. Write a complete draft filling in all sections (Highlights, What's Changed,
               Breaking Changes, New Features, Bug Fixes).
            4. Remove HTML comment placeholders and replace with actual content.
            5. If a section has no relevant changes, write "None." for that section.
            6. Do not modify the YAML frontmatter.

            Files to draft:
            ${{ steps.classify.outputs.empty_meta }}
            Format: sdk|file_path|previous_release_tag (one per line)

            After editing all files, commit with message:

            The following release note files have been partially or fully written by a human.
            For each file listed below:

            1. Run `git diff <previous_tag>..HEAD -- . ':!docs/release-notes'` to see code changes.
            2. Run `git log --oneline <previous_tag>..HEAD` for commit history.
            3. Compare the existing notes against actual changes.
            4. Fix any inaccuracies (wrong descriptions, missing context).
            5. Add missing changes that should be documented.
            6. Remove entries that don't match actual code changes.
            7. Preserve the author's voice and structure where correct.
            8. Do not modify the YAML frontmatter.

            If the notes already accurately cover all relevant changes, make NO changes
            and do NOT commit.
