# GitHub workflows

Validate workflow edits with `dev/nix-shell 'just lint-config'`.

Mobile release tags use `GH_APP_ID` and `GH_APP_PK` for the release App.
The App installation must grant Contents write and Workflows write.
App tokens are available only in isolated permission and tag push jobs.
These jobs do not run SDK or release tools. The tag push job imports a Git
bundle into a new bare repository.
Resolve the requested ref before SDK code runs. All SDK jobs use that fixed
source SHA. Android tags must point to it. iOS can use one direct release commit
that changes only the iOS release files. The push job checks this before it
creates its token.
`just lint-config` checks the tag transfer with a local Git HTTP remote.

- Do not enable full Nix build logs by default in CI. For explicit debugging, run `nix log <drv-path>` or add `--print-build-logs` to a manual `nix build` command.
- Pass JavaScript shard flags directly to the `just` recipe. An extra `--` is forwarded to Vitest and prevents sharding.

- The iOS and Swift conformance jobs use disposable native services through
  `dev/nix-shell 'just backend ci COMMAND'`. Each job creates its own database
  and S3 bucket. Failed-job-only reruns do not need a deployment job.
- Keep both Swift job filters current when native setup inputs change.
  `test-native-backend.yml` checks wrapper cleanup and the real S3 contract.
  It also checks the owned loopback listeners and metrics endpoint. Backend
  source and build-input changes select this job, and it gates aggregate
  `Test`. The native acceptance job has no cache-write token.
  Service logs are retained for 7 days.
