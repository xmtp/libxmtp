# iOS SDK 4.9.1

## Highlights

<!-- AI-generated draft - please review and edit -->

## What's Changed

- The package now lives in the `libxmtp` repository instead of `xmtp-ios`. You will need to update your imports to reference the new location.
- You can now import the SDK using either a static or dynamically linked framework. The static framework will load faster, but can increase the size of your app. Static remains the default.

## Breaking Changes

- For those importing the SDK using Swift Package Manager, the minimum supported Swift version is now 6.2. CocoaPods users are not affected.
